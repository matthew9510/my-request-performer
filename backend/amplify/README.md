# AWS Amplify

AWS Amplify is a development platform for building secure, scalable mobile and web applications. It makes it easy for you to authenticate users, 
securely store data and user metadata, authorize selective access to data, integrate machine learning, analyze application metrics, and execute 
server-side code. Amplify covers the complete mobile application development workflow from version control, code testing, to production deployment, 
and it easily scales with your business from thousands of users to tens of millions. The Amplify libraries and CLI, part of the Amplify Framework, 
are open source and offer a pluggable interface that enables you to customize and create your own plugins.
