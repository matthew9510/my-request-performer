# Endpoint Test Using Postman

We'll be using Postman to populate our new table with test data using a PUT request.

##### Postman Configuration:
- Endpoint: https://y05btwgzvf.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/dev/requests
- Authorization: no auth

##### Populate with sample data
- From the body tab select 'raw' of type JSON
- Provide Payload

        {
            "artist": "Outkast",
            "song": "Roses",
            "memo": "Birthday!!!",
            "type": "Not Sure on value",
            "status": "pending",
            "event_id": "705346f8-c9da-4dc4-b0b8-6898595dcaaf",
            "requester_id": "Not Sure on value",
            "original_request_id": "Not Sure on value"
        }

Successful PUT Response:

    {
        "success": "Successfully added item to the requests table!",
        "record": {
            "artist": "Outkast",
            "song": "Roses",
            "memo": "Birthday!!!",

        }
    }
